# once-upon-a-count
😺 This is a smol project to practice the topics I'm currently learning.

✨What does this even do?!✨
- You choose a topic 🤷‍♀️
- Storalyzer (of course the program has its own name, duh 😒) sends the topic to an LLM
- LLM generates a story on that topic 🤖
- Then our Storalyzer counts the number of words and occurrences of each letter of the alphabet in the story 🐱‍💻
- Then we pretty-print the result 👻

📜Topics practiced here🖌
📌 Python syntax and execution model

📌 Primitive data types

📌 Variables, naming conventions, and memory management

📌 Operators (arithmetic)

📌 String manipulation and methods
